If you add users to your Kinde business manually or via API, you can send them a welcome or invitation email using a webhook. 

## Use webhooks to send an invitation or welcome email

1. Go to **Settings > Webhooks** and select **Add webhook**.
2. Fill in the name and details, and select an endpoint for receiving the hook. This might be in your product.
3. Choose the `user.created` event trigger.
4. Select **Save**.

## Prepare to receive the webhook

- Set up the email template you want to send via the hook. The email needs to come from your email server and should contain a link to the sign in screen.
- Filter the webhook data when it hits the endpoint, to identify if the user was created manually or by API. The `source` is either `admin` or `api` . It's up to you if you treat these differently.

## Test the webhook

1. Add a fake user to an organization either manually or via the Kinde Management API using an email address you can access.
2. Check that the hook works and the email is sent.
3. When the user goes to sign in for the first time with the same email address, they should automatically be synced by Kinde with the invited profile.
