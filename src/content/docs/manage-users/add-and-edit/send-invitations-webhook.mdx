If you add users to your Kinde business manually or via API, you can send them a welcome or invitation email using a webhook. 

## Use webhooks to send an invitation or welcome email

1. Go to **Settings > Webhooks** and select **Add webhook**.
2. Fill in the name and details, and select an endpoint for receiving the hook. This might be in your product.
3. Choose the `user.created` event trigger.
4. Select **Save**.

## Prepare to receive the webhook

- Set up the email template you want to send via the webhook. The email should be sent from your email server and contain a link to the sign-in screen.
- Verify the webhook signature before processing to ensure the request is authentic.
- Respond with a 2xx quickly after queuing work; use retries and make processing idempotent (e.g., de-duplicate by event ID).
- Filter the webhook payload to determine whether the user was created manually or via API. The `source` field is `admin` or `api`. Treat these differently if needed.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "type": "user.created",
  "id": "evt_123",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "usr_abc",
    "email": "new.user@example.com",
    "source": "admin"
  }
}
```

## Test the webhook

1. Add a fake user to an organization either manually or via the Kinde Management API using an email address you can access.
2. Check that the hook works and the email is sent.
3. When the user goes to sign in for the first time with the same email address, they should automatically be synced by Kinde with the invited profile.
