---

This topic is for people who want to import users in bulk to Kinde from Auth0. For other formats, see [import users via JSON or CSV](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/).

## File requirements

- Auth0 data - User details and passwords need to be in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) format
- File size up to 20MB supported

If you’ve got large user sets (over 20MB) or are concerned about file size limits, you might consider importing in batches, or contact us for import support.

## Before you import users

- [Create organizations in Kinde](/build/organizations/add-and-manage-organizations/) - only if you use this function to support multi-tenancy (for example, in a B2B structure) or if you manage separate user groups this way.
- Add [roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/) and [permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in Kinde, if you intend to import these details with users.
- If your users sign on with passwords, make sure you [Enable password authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/) before importing them

## Cases in usernames

Kinde treats usernames as case-insensitive. In other words, we ignore case. We do this because it eliminates the possibility of auth issues and fraud when two usernames are identical in every aspect except the case of one of their letters. 

We are happy to support users choosing an aesthetically pleasing username combination, like `RosyRose` or `BuilderBob`. We just don't also support separate identities for `rosYrosE` and `BUilderbob`. Before importing users, we recommend checking that all usernames are unique in more than just case.

## Prepare Auth0 data

When you export user details from Auth0:

- select all the default fields and add the `identities` field to the import list.
- select the NDJSON file format for export.

`Identities` data distinguishes the type of identity, specifically the `connection` attribute. e.g. username, phone, GitHub, Google, etc.

### How Auth0 user identities are treated on import

Social identities without an email can be imported, and are identified by the connection type. You can import users with multiple identities, these will be listed under the user’s profile.

Kinde supports migrating the following authentication methods from Auth0: Usernames, Email, Phone, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, GitHub, Twitch, Bitbucket. Auth methods are shown in the `connection` attribute. These are represented as follows in the identity data:

- Username-Password-Authentication
- email
- sms
- google-oauth2
- apple
- microsoft
- github
- twitch
- facebook
- bitbucket
- windowslive

### Import options

When importing users from Auth0 NDJSON files, you have three options:

1. **Import users only** - choose this method if you want to allow users to reset their password or sign in another way.
2. **Import passwords only** - only choose this if you have already imported users.

## How to import users

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**, then select **Import users**.
2. Select **From Auth0**.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to import the data.
4. If there are any [errors with the import](/manage-users/add-and-edit/troubleshoot-user-import-errors/), you will be able to view them afterwards.
5. Most import errors can be fixed by editing the JSON file and then re-importing into Kinde. Any records that have already been imported, will be ignored.

## Impact on end-users

Importing all your existing users and passwords should mean that your end users won’t notice anything when they next sign in. This is the optimal experience. However:

- If a user changes their password after the user export and while the migration is in progress, they will be prompted to reset their password on the next sign in.
- If you have set up a new authentication method as part of the user migration (for instance, going passwordless) your users will be prompted to use the new method on sign in.
- If you add or remove roles or permissions, they may gain/lose access to parts of your system.

## Weak passwords are not rejected on import

When you import passwords, Kinde does not check for password strength. However, if you do not also include a `TRUE` in the `password_verified` column of the CSV, Kinde will send a one-time password to the user the first time they try to sign in, in order to verify their identity.

In future, we may add the ability to check password strength and initiate a password change if it's deemed to weak by standard password criteria.

## Re-importing does not update user info

If you add a user via import and they start authenticating via Kinde, and then you import their records again with changes - for example, a name change or a new email - that information will not be updated in Kinde.

Similarly, if a user has changed the spelling of their name or has new permissions, and you import data containing outdated information, the older data will NOT override their current record in Kinde.

We recommend managing updates to user information via the Kinde admin, or via API.

## Communication to users

Kinde does not send any notifications or invitations to users when they are added to Kinde via import. The idea is that your users have a seamless experience that feels (almost) like it always has in your app.

If you’ve made changes to their sign in experience — for example adding multi-factor authentication — then consider contacting your users to let them know their sign in experience will be changed.
