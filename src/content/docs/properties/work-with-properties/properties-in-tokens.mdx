You can select what information to include in application tokens. Before you can add properties to tokens, they need to be set to **public** in the property settings. See [Add and manage properties](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/).

## Applications and token customization rules

- You can edit **Access tokens**, **ID tokens**, and **M2M tokens** for backend applications.
- You can edit **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** for frontend applications.
- You can only edit **M2M tokens** for M2M applications.

2. Select **Tokens**.
3. Scroll to the **Token customization** section.
4. Select **Customize** on the relevant token type. The **Customize [access/ID/M2M] token** dialog opens.
5. Select the **Properties** you want to add. These will be included in the token.
