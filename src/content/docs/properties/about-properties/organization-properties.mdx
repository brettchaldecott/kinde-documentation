You can use the properties feature to manage custom data fields and custom token properties for organizations. Add and edit organization properties manually in Kinde, or via API.

## View custom data for an organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Select the organization who’s properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.

## Edit custom data values for an organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Select the organization who’s properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.
4. Select **Edit** next to the property you want to update.
5. In the window that opens, enter or edit the value.
6. Select **Save**.

## Manage custom data via API

You can also manage organization properties via the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/organizations/patch/api/v1/organizations/{org_code}/properties).
