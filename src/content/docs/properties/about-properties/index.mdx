Properties are a way for you to add custom data to Kinde, and then use that data for custom claims and in tokens.

Kinde comes with a standard set of properties that make up business, user, application, and organization profiles, but you can also [add custom properties](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/) to capture any data you like.

For example, you might want to record a billing address separate to a delivery address, or capture screen names, job titles, or other customer information.

Properties can also be used to create custom claims.

## Properties can be passed in tokens

You can choose to make a property ‘public’ so it can be made available to be passed via a token. This is essentially a way of creating a custom claim, enabling data to be transferred system to system, via API. For more information see [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).

## Kinde-included properties

To get you started, we’ve included a set of common properties. You can easily identify these as the code key starts with `kp-` meaning Kinde-provided. You cannot edit or delete these properties.

## Custom properties

The needs of every business are different, that’s why you can create your own properties and use them any way you want. For example, you might want to create a property to collect marketing information, identifiers from your app, or customer relationship data.

## Property categories

Properties can be organized using [property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/). When you create a category, it becomes a heading in a user, application, or organization record. Property categories ensure similar fields are grouped together for easier display. 

### Organization properties example

| Category             | Properties                                         | For          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Billing information  | Billing contact, Billing address, Billing phone    | Organization |
| Delivery information | Delivery contact, Delivery address, Delivery phone | Organization |

### User properties example

| Category         | Properties         | For  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| Accounts contact | Name, email, phone | User |
| Next of kin      | Name, email, phone | User |

### Application properties example

A common use case for application properties is to correlate M2M apps with organizations.

| Category         | Properties         | For         |
| -----------      | ------------       | ----        |
| Application org  | Organization ID    | Application |
| External ID      | External ID        | Application |


## How properties are displayed in Kinde

The way you label and group properties impacts how the data is displayed in Kinde. Here’s an example of how properties are displayed:

<img

  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

## Properties can be added and edited via API

You need to [set up an M2M application to access the Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/), and then create and edit properties using [dedicated endpoints](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties).
