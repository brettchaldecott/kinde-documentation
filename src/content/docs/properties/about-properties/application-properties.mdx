You can use properties to manage custom data for applications. You can edit property values manually in Kinde or via API. For example, you might want to associate an application with a specific internal ID to reference your systems.

## View application custom data

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.

## Edit custom data values for an application

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.
4. Select **Edit** next to the property you want to update.
5. In the window that opens, enter or edit the value.
6. Select **Save**.

## Manage custom data via API

You can also manage application properties via the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties).
