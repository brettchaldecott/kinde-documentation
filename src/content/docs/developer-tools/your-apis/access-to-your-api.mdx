ai_summary: Guide to providing programmatic access to APIs for third parties using M2M applications and tokens
---

There are a number of ways to provide your users with programmatic access to your API and applications via Kinde.

You need to [register your API with Kinde](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/) before you begin.

## API access via an M2M application

Here’s the process:

- Create a machine to machine (M2M) application
- Connect the application to your API
- Provide access to the user via token or app keys

### Create a M2M application

You will want to create a separate M2M application for each user, system, or business who needs to access your API. It is not secure to share access via the same tokens or app keys.

1. Go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **Add Application**.
3. In the dialog that opens, give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including **Domain** details, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - are issued for the application.

### Authorize the API to access the application

1. In the application list, find the M2M app you created and select **View details**.
2. Select **APIs** in the menu. A list of all available APIs shows.
3. Select the three dots next to the API you want the application to access, and select **Authorize**. 
4. Select **Save**.

If you need to cut off access to your API for a user, select the three dots menu and select **Revoke authorization**.

## API access via API keys

Allow users to manage their own API keys to access your API, including initializing the request, rotating, and deleting keys. Follow this [quickstart guide](/manage-your-apis/about-api-keys/api-keys-quick-start/). This is much more secure and preferable than manually copying the app keys from the M2M application and providing them to the third-party. 

## Provide access via a token

A third party can request a token using the relevant `audience` in the claim, for example:

```jsx
POST https://yourbusiness.kinde.com/oauth2/token
{
  "client_id": "XXX",
  "client_secret": "XXX",
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "audience": "http://api.example.com/api"
}
```
Granting access this way means you don't have to share the Client ID and Secret with anyone.

## Get a test token to test API access

Follow this guide to [quickly generate a test token](/developer-tools/your-apis/test-token-from-kinde/) to test access to your API.
