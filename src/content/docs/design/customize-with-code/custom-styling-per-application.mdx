ai_summary: The guide explains how to use an application's clientId to conditionally render unique styles for multiple apps from a single code repository.
---

## Overview

You can apply unique HTML and CSS styling to each Kinde application within the same business account. Although you can only connect one Git repository for your custom UI pages, you can use conditional rendering to serve different designs based on which application is being accessed.

This guide will walk you through how to use the application's **Client ID** to render unique styles and layouts. This doc is based on the tests and implementation we ran and provides example code, folder layout, and implemention checklist. 

The **clientID** is a unique identifier assigned to each application in Kinde. This value distinguishes one app from another, allowing your template code to detect which application is active and render the appropriate HTML and CSS for each app accordingly. 

---

## Solution: Conditional rendering

The key to this solution is the `clientId`, a unique identifier assigned to every application you create in Kinde. This ID is passed in the `request` object to your custom pages. By checking the value of the `clientId`, your code can determine which application is active and render the corresponding HTML and CSS.

This process happens server-side, so there's no performance loss for your users.

## Before you begin

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Set up a [custom domain](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://kinde.com/docs/config/custom-domains/) for your Kinde business.
- Connected a [Git repository](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://kinde.com/docs/design/customize-with-code/set-up-your-environment/) to manage your custom UI pages.
- Make sure to already have your custom design files working. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.kinde.com/design/customize-with-code/customize-with-css-html/) for more details.

## Implementation

Follow these steps to set up conditional styling for your Kinde applications.

### 1. File Structure

Your repository needs to follow a specific structure for Kinde to recognize the files. For this example, we are using the simplest structure with the `(default)` folder to act as a fallback and a `page.tsx` file within it. This file will contain your conditional logic.


```
myApp/
├── kindeSrc/
│   └── environment/
│       └── pages/
│           └── (kinde)/
│               └── (default)/
│                   └── page.tsx
│           └── layout.tsx
├── package.json
└── kinde.json
```

**Note:** For this specific example, we focus on the default design, but you can use this for your sign up and sign pages. 

### 3. Access the Client ID

In your `page.tsx` file, you can access the `clientId` from the `request` object that is passed to your page component.

```js

const DefaultPage: React.FC<KindePageEvent> = async ({ context, request }) => {
  let clientId = request.authUrlParams?.clientId || null;

  // ... rest of your code
};`

```

### 4. Implement the Conditional Logic

Use the `clientId` variable to build your conditional logic. You can use an `if/else` statement, a `switch` statement, or a ternary operator to render different JSX for each application.

The following example shows how to render different content for three separate applications (Next.js, Python, and Nuxt.js), with a default fallback.

### `kindeSrc/environment/pages/(kinde)/(default)/page.tsx`

```js

'use server';

import {
  getKindeWidget,
  fetch,
  type KindePageEvent,
} from '@kinde/infrastructure';
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server.browser';
import Layout from '../../layout';

const DefaultPage: React.FC<KindePageEvent> = async ({ context, request }) => {
  // 1. Access the client ID from the request object
  let clientId = request.authUrlParams?.clientId || null;

  // Example: Fetching dynamic content (optional)
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://cdn.builder.io/api/v3/content/login-page-data?apiKey=c065718cfdf849a89015b311c8d3185e&sort.createdDate=-1>',
    {
      headers: {},
      method: 'GET',
    }
  );
  const {
    loginPageImage,
    signInFormTextTop,
    signupFormTextTop,
    signInFormTextBottom,
    signupFormTextBottom,
  } = res?.data?.results?.[0]?.data || {};
  const isUserOnLoginOrRegisterPage = request?.route?.flow;

  return (
    <Layout
      context={context}
      request={request}
      props={res?.data?.results?.[0]?.data}
    >
      {/* 2. Use conditional rendering based on the client ID */}
      {clientId == 'ca3c184c80c740bd842777bceee2df74' ? (
        
        <div className='container'>
          {/* Content for the Next.js App */}
          <h1>Styling for the First App - Next.js</h1>
          <h2>Client ID: {clientId}</h2>
          <div className='login-form-wrapper'>
            {getKindeWidget()}
          </div>
        </div>
      
      ) : clientId == 'c41376bd84c24244b3122dd41cd154ba' ? (
        
        <div className='container-2'>
          {/* Content for the Python App */}
          <h1>Styling for the Second App - Python</h1>
          <h2>Client ID: {clientId}</h2>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Company</th>
              <th>Contact</th>
              <th>Country</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
              <td>Maria Anders</td>
              <td>Germany</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <div className='login-form-wrapper'>
            {getKindeWidget()}
          </div>
        </div>

      ) : (
        
        <div className='container-default'>
           {/* Fallback content for any other app (e.g., Nuxt app) */}
          <h1>Default Kinde Authentication Page</h1>
          <h2>Client ID: {clientId || 'Not available'}</h2>
          <div className='login-form-wrapper'>
            {getKindeWidget()}
          </div>
        </div>

      )}
    </Layout>
  );
};

// Page Component
export default async function Page(event: KindePageEvent): Promise<string> {
  const page = await DefaultPage(event);
  return renderToString(page);
}

```

**Note:** The custom CSS for classes like `.container` and `.container-2` would typically be defined in your `layout.tsx` file or in a separate CSS file.

## Expected output

When a user authenticates through each of your applications, they will see a different page design based on your conditional logic.

- **Next.js App (`clientId`: `ca3c184c80c740bd842777bceee2df74`)**
    - The user will see the content inside the first block, with the heading "Styling for the First App - Next.js".

- **Python App (`clientId`: `c41376bd84c24244b3122dd41cd154ba`)**
    - The user will see the second block, with the heading "Styling for the Second App - Python" and a custom HTML table.

- **Nuxt.js App or any other app (`clientId`: `730c34be02c945248e206ec07cd591f3`)**
    - Since this ID doesn't match the first two conditions, the user will see the final fallback block with the heading "Default Kinde Authentication Page".
