You can run multiple businesses on Kinde. This is helpful if you want to create different businesses with different user groups. For instance if you are a founder working on multiple applications, or you also run a business in a different region. Organizations, users, branding, and activity are all managed separately.

## **Add a new business**

1. Select your business profile in the bottom left of the Kinde home screen.
2. From the menu, select **Switch business**. A screen showing all your businesses opens. 
3. Select **Add business**.
4. Complete the form, including your preferred Kinde domain and data storage region. These details cannot be changed later.
5. Select **Save**.
6. To complete the setup, select the business to switch to it. Follow the quickstart prompts.

## **Switch between businesses**

1. Select your business profile in the bottom left of the Kinde home screen.
2. From the menu, select **Switch business*. A screen showing all your businesses opens. 
3. Select the one you want to work in. The business loads.

## Delete a business

You can only [delete a business](/manage-your-account/your-data/delete-business/) that is on the Kinde free plan. If you have a paid subscription, you need to email [support@kinde.com](mailto:support@kinde.com) to downgrade from a paid account before deleting. Include the Kinde domain and business name in the email, and send it from the owner account email.

Deleting a business is a nuclear and irreversible action, so make sure you [export](/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/) all your important data before doing this.
