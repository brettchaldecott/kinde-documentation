If an organization requires a unique setup for the self-service portal, you can do this using an advanced organization function. If you set this up, the authorized members of the organization will be able to perform the selected functions. 

1. In Kinde, open the organization you want to customize.
2. In the side menu, select **Self-serve portal**.
3. If you don't have Advanced organizations switched on, enable this now.
4. Switch on the **Override environment settings** option.

5. Select the options you want to be available in the self-serve portal for this org. 
6. Select any additional changes you want to make for members of the org (users) to access. Note that individual access is still controlled via system roles.
7. Select **Save**.
