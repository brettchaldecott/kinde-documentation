You can delete organizations in Kinde, but doing so removes all users from the organization, and deletes organization settings, feature flags, and data.

Users who belong to other organizations remain assigned to those organizations. Users who only belong to the organization you are deleting will be removed, but not deleted from Kinde.

## Caution: Before you delete

Deleting an organization cannot be reversed, so we recommend you:

- [Reassign users to other organizations](/manage-users/about/manage-users-across-organizations/) (if you need to)
- Review [feature flags](/releases/feature-flags/manage-feature-flags/) that might only apply to this organization
- [Export any data](/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/) that you want

## Deleting an organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. In the list, find the organization you want to delete.
3. Select the three dots menu at the far right and then select **Delete organization**.
4. In the confirmation window that appears, select **Yes, I definitely want to delete**, and then select **Delete organization**.
