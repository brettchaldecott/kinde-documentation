All Kinde businesses come with one default organization. Some businesses will create more organizations to support a multi-tenancy business model. [Learn more about organizations](/build/organizations/multi-tenancy-using-organizations/).

- To add organizations manually, follow the procedure below.
- To add multiple organizations, we recommend importing them. See [Import organizations](/build/organizations/import-organizations/).

## Add an organization

1. In the main menu, select **Organizations.** The **Organizations** page opens.
2. Select **Add organization**.
3. Enter the name of the organization.
4. If you want, add an **External organization ID**. This is the ID you use to identify the organization, and enables you to import users and assign them to organizations by matching to this ID.
5. Select **Save**. The organization now appears on the **Organization** page, and is assigned a unique code. Developers need this code for using the Kinde API and SDKs.
6. To view the details or get the code again, select the three dots and then select **View details**.

## Change the name of the default organization

When you first sign up to Kinde, you have one organization already created for you. This is the default organization that all users will be added to, until you create other organizations.

You can change the name of this organization, but not the unique code.

1. In the main menu, select **Organizations.** The **Organizations** page opens.
2. Select the three dots next to the default organization, and select **View details**.
3. Edit the organization name and select **Save**.
