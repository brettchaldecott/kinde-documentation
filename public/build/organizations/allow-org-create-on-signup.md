By default, Kinde allows organizations to be created when a user signs up if the `is_create_org` param is passed. This is helpful if your customers are organizations and you want them to be able to self-sign up.

If you want to, you can disable organization creation for new sign ups.

## Switch off organization creation on sign up

You can switch this option off at any time.

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Policies**.
2. Switch off the **Allow organization creation on sign up** option.
3. Select **Save**.
