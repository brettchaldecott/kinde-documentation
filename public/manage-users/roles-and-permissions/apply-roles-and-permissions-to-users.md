Roles and permissions are defined at the business level, but set at the level of an **Organization**. So if you have users who belong to multiple organizations, you’ll need to set their roles and permissions separately.

<Aside>

Users must belong to an organization before you can assign them roles or permissions.

</Aside>

You can add and remove roles and permissions for users in an organization. If you can’t find a role or permission, you may need to add it. See [Define user permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) and [Define user roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/).

You can also assign roles and permissions to users by [updating their profiles in bulk](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/).
