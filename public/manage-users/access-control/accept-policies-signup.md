When a user signs up to your app, site, or platform via Kinde, their acceptance of product terms and privacy policy is implied (see the left image).

However, some businesses want to record explicit acceptance and track who has accepted, this is also known as a clickwrap agreement, click-accept, click-to-sign, or clickthrough agreement (see the right image).

## Switch on explicit acceptance of policies

When you switch on explicit acceptance, it is set at the business level and will apply to all environments and organizations in your business.

1. Go to **Settings > Business details**.
2. Add the URL location of the **Terms of use URL** or **Privacy policy URL**, or both. Both are not required. You may have already added these when you set up authentication.
3. In the **Global display settings** section, switch on the **Show a policy acceptance checkbox on sign up** toggle.
4. Select **Save**.

## Acceptance experience for users

The next time a user signs up, they will be prompted to select the acceptance checkbox before they are allowed to sign up to your service.

- If they sign up with email, the acceptance box appears inline, on the sign up page (see image above).
- If they sign up using a third party service like Google or GitHub, a dialog will appear, prompting them to accept (see image below).

## Check if a user has accepted

You can see in a userâ€™s profile when they accepted the policies, terms and conditions.

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Filter the list and select the user you want to view.
3. In the **Activity** section for the user, the dates of acceptance are shown in the **Log** list, with **Terms of use accepted on** and **Privacy policy accepted on** shown in the description.

   These are shown as a log activity because when one of the policies is updated and new acceptance is recorded, the accepted date will also change.
