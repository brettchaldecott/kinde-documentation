Scopes define what actions a token is allowed to perform when calling an API.

For example, you might create scopes like `read:users` or `write:flags` to control how each machine-to-machine (M2M) app can interact with your services.

To learn how to create custom scopes and assign them to APIs and applications, see [Custom API scopes in Kinde](https://docs.kinde.com/developer-tools/your-apis/custom-api-scopes/). For information about API scopes for M2M apps, see [Manage API scopes for M2M applications](/developer-tools/your-apis/api-scopes-m2m-applications/).
