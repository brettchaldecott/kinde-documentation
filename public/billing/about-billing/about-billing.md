Kinde billing gives you the ability to charge customers for your services and collect revenue.

As part of using this feature, you can:

- Create and manage plans, and make them visible to your customers
- Create and customize a pricing table for plan selection
- Implement specific pricing models to suit your product
- Use Stripe for secure handling of payments and invoicing
- Link organizations (B2B) and individual customers (B2C) to a plan
- Handle plan upgrade, downgrade, and cancellation
- Enable self-serve account management for customers
- Customize the pricing table to make the whole experience on-brand

Billing makes the Kinde platform _the_ essential development infrastructure for managing the customer lifecycle across every part of your business. From registration to plan selection, authorization to provisioning, releases to upgrades.

## This is our first billing release

Billing is a really complex area of app development, so while this release is tested and ready, we are actively working on improvements from day one.

### How to send feedback

It would be amazing if you can send any feedback you have [support@kinde.com](mailto:support@kinde.com) so we can quickly collect and prioritize improvements.

## Known limitations

These are current limitations that we are aware of and are working on adding.

- Support for plan models with free trial periods
- Annual and quarterly subscriptions. Only monthly is available right now.
- Changes to the billing cycle (e.g. choose billing anniversaries, etc.)
- Add-ons and discounts that can be applied to individual subscriptions
