Connected apps let your users access third party tools and services through Kinde. When you add a connection, you’ll need to define which features (or scopes) that you want to be made available. To get the connection up and running, you’ll need to do some steps in Kinde and some in the app you are connecting. ## **Before you add a connected app** - Set up a [machine to machine application](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/) - Ensure you have at least one [end-user created](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/) ## **Step 1: Add the connected app in Kinde** 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Connected apps**. 2. Select **Connect an app**. A dialog opens. 3. Select the connected app you want from the available apps. 4. Select **Save**. The app will appear in the list of your connected apps. 5. Select **Configure** on the tile and copy the **Provider to Kinde** callback URL. 6. Next: Set up the app. See instructions for setting up apps below. ## **Step 2: Set up the app you want to connect** - [Google Drive](/integrate/connected-apps/google-drive-connected-app/) - [GitHub](/integrate/connected-apps/github-connected-app/) - [GitLab](/integrate/connected-apps/gitlab-connected-app/) - [Patreon](/integrate/connected-apps/patreon-connected-app/) - [Discord](/integrate/connected-apps/discord-connected-app/) - [Microsoft 365](/integrate/connected-apps/microsoft-365-connected-app/) ## **Step 3: Configure the connected app in Kinde** To complete this procedure, you need to have set up the app. See relevant instructions below. 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Connected apps**. 2. On the app tile, select **Configure**. 3. On the Details tab: 1. Enter a name. 2. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the app, e.g. Google Drive. 3. Enter a reference key that will be used in your app’s code. 4. Enter the callback URL for your app. 5. Select **Save**. 4. In the **Permissions** tab, select the permissions (scopes) that you want to access via the connection. 5. Select **Save**. The next time a user signs in, they will be prompted to allow the above permissions. ## **Step 4: Get an access token via the Kinde Management API** This final step needs to be performed in your own app, using that app’s language. The steps below simulate the process in Postman. 1. Get the user ID of one of your users by calling the following API in Postman: `https://yourdomain.kinde.com/api/v1/users`. In the below example, the `id` of the only user in the business is `kp:xxxxx...` <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/4226353f-43a6-4fbd-381c-5f6817e32800/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> Note: The user’s endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token to call this API. 2. Using Postman, call the auth url endpoint to get a URL that will allow you to connect, e.g. to Google. The URL is: `https://<KINDE_URL>/api/v1/connected_apps/auth_url?key_code_ref=<KEY>&user_id=<USER_ID>` 3. Replace: - `<KINDE_URL>` with your Kinde business url, e.g. `mybiz.kinde.com` - `<KEY>` with the unique key you gave your connected app - `<USER_ID>` with the user id you got in step 1 Note: The `auth_url` endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token to call this API. You will get back a URL and session_id in the response if the call was successful: <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/040b6860-0774-4128-fbb9-95dd24774300/public" alt="Getting session_id in Postman" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> 4. Copy the URL from the call to `url` and paste it in a browser’s address bar. This should redirect you to get authenticated. 5. Authorize the requested scopes for the application. You will be redirected to the URL defined in the `Kinde to application` . 6. Use Postman to call the `connected_apps/token` API to get an access token that has been granted the scopes you have defined previously. The URL is: `https://<KINDE_URL>/api/v1/connected_apps/token?session_id=<SESSION_ID>` 7. Replace: - `<KINDE_URL>` with your Kinde business url, e.g. `mybiz.kinde.com` - `<SESSION_ID>` with the session_id that was returned when calling the `auth_url` endpoint Note: The `connected_apps/token` endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token. You will get an access token back from the call. This token can be used to call the connected services. 8. You’re ready to use the connection. Below is an example API call to Google Drive. ### **Example connected app access - Google Drive** 1. In your code or using Postman, call the Google Drive API to list files. The URL is `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files` . 2. You will need to use the access token you obtained earlier, and pass it as a bearer token in the Authorization header. Here’s what the call and return looks like. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/c76b98f4-828e-4147-4ff1-32fa489e1400/public" alt="Calling Google Drive API in Postman" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## **Disconnect a connected app** You can disconnect a connected app from Kinde, however this does not revoke permissions. To revoke permissions you need to call the `/connected apps/revoke` endpoint. 1. Go to **Settings > Connected Apps**. 2. Select the three dots menu on the tile for the connected app, then select **Disconnect**. A confirmation window pops up. 3. Select **Disconnect**.

Once authenticated, you’ll be redirected to the app’s homepage. You should see your profile name displayed. ![enter username](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8fe71e60-19a5-4a8d-4560-33ac6d0af900/public) That’s it! You’ve successfully connected Kinde authentication with Bravo Studio and tested it on your mobile app. <Aside title="Troubleshooting"> If a deployment error occurs, trying changing the Bravo callback URLs in Kinde to be lowercase. See step 11 of **Connect Bravo Studio with Kinde** above. E.g. change `https://a01JMF34GB3VYX7Z5GVQXSGYFP0.callbacks.bravostudio.app` to `https://a01jmf34gb3vyx7z5gvqxsgyfp0.callbacks.bravostudio.app`. It's odd but it has fixed an issue previously. </Aside> ## You did it! Your app can now securely sign in users and display their profile data. This is a huge step towards building production-ready apps with authentication powered by Kinde. What’s next? - Explore [Bravo’s API features](https://docs.bravostudio.app/connect-api) to connect your app to live data. - Dive deeper into Kinde’s [documentation](https://docs.kinde.com/) to unlock more authentication capabilities. - Start customizing your app’s design and logic in Bravo to make it your own. Happy building!

integrate, third-party-tools

Kinde works with edge worker services and providers. We have tested the following: - [Nuxt on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt#edge-functions) - [Next.js Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/edge) - [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) - [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) You will need to follow the edge worker service instructions linked above, to get things running. Here’s an example of how we set up Cloudflare Workers. ## Example Cloudflare Workers integration <Aside> With server-side SDKs, you'll need to handle JWT implementation (generate & validate JWT tokens) without relying on external libraries, so it is suitable to deploy within the Cloudflare environment. [Here’s some docs to help](https://github.com/tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt). </Aside> 1. Set up a Cloudflare account. 2. Install Wrangler. This is Cloudflare’s CLI. ```bash brew install wrangler ``` 3. Run the Wrangler login to authenticate into your Cloudflare account: ```bash wrangler login ``` 4. Create a repository to install dependencies using the below command. During this process, answer any questions best suited to your app: ```bash wrangler init ``` 5. Combine the folder created for Cloudflare + kinde sdk/starter kit. 1. Sort out any conflicts in the code (including your package.json / package-lock.json files), such as conflicting scripts, commands, dependencies, etc. 2. Merge into the one file. 6. Install Kinde dependencies if required. Here’s an example for React: ```bash npm install @kinde-oss/kinde-auth-react ``` 7. Deploy your project. We suggest you deploy to your local environment for testing. ```bash npm run pages\:deploy ``` You’ll get a link to see the changes.

# Integrate - Third party tools - Kinde and Resend for custom SMTP

> Guide to configuring Kinde with Resend for custom SMTP email delivery including API key setup, domain verification, and SMTP configuration

resend, smtp, email, api key, domain verification, email deliverability, troubleshooting
integrate, third-party-tools

You can configure Kinde to send emails using your existing Resend account. This means your users will receive communications from your business’s email address, and not Kinde’s. Other benefits include better control of email deliverability, analytics and tracking, scalability, email compliance, etc. Please review the documentation at [Customize email sender](/get-started/connect/customize-email-sender/) for details about how custom SMTP works with Kinde and third party providers. ## Generate an API key from Resend You'll need an API key from Resend to use as the password for authenticating with their SMTP server. You can use an existing API key from Resend if you have one already. Or you can create a new API key from the Resend dashboard by going to the API keys section and clicking `Create API Key`. See Resend's [API Keys](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/introduction) documentation for more details. ## Whitelist domain Resend also requires you to verify the domain being used for the emails. See Resend's [Managing Domains](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction) documentation for verifying your domain. ## Add email sender SMTP details If you are setting this up and your production environment is already live, we recommend testing this in a staging or test environment first. 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Email**. 2. Enter a **Sender name**. This is usually your business name, but might be a specific person. 3. Enable the **Use custom sender** switch. The SMTP details section opens. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/d4c4b57d-9f1a-4b1c-638c-0a770c4fe400/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> 4. Enter the **Sender email**. This is the address your users will receive emails from and should be one of the verified domains from your Resend account. 5. Enter the SMTP details of your email provider: - Server name - `smtp.resend.com` - Port - `465` - User - `resend` - Password - Use the API key generated from your Resend account 6. Select **Send test email**. This sends a test email to the email address you are logged into Kinde with. 7. If the test is successful, select **Save**. 8. If the test is not successful, check the SMTP details (step 5) and try sending a test email again. If this does not work, see the troubleshooting section below. ## Troubleshooting If sending a test email fails: - Verify network connectivity to smtp.resend.com. - Confirm the port, user, and API key are correct. - Review error messages on the Resend dashboard. For more details, see Resend's troubleshooting guide: https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/troubleshooting

# Integrate - Third party tools - Create a to-do app with Kinde and Supabase

> A walkthough example on how to create a to-do list app using Kinde and Supabase, as previously set up.

supabase, postgresql, row level security, rls, nextjs, jwt, authentication, database, todo app
integrate, third-party-tools

User authentication and secure data access are critical components of modern web applications. Kinde simplifies the process by handling user authentication, managing session tokens, and offering robust user management features. When combined with Supabase's powerful database management and PostgreSQL’s Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, you can create a secure, scalable application that ensures user-specific data access. In this guide, we will walk through building a personalized and secure to-do application. We’ll use Next.js as the application framework. ### What you need - A Kinde & Supabase project built [using this guide](/integrate/third-party-tools/kinde-supabase/) ## Step 1: Create to-do table in Supabase 1. Sign in to your Supabase dashboard and go to **SQL Editor.** 2. Select the **plus “+” icon**, and then **Create a new snippet**. ![Create Snippet in Supabase](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/ee3d1db7-9029-4ea1-9d76-f573af311b00/public) 3. Paste the following SQL code into the command window and select **Run**: ```sql -- Create the table CREATE TABLE todos ( id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, task TEXT NOT NULL, user_id TEXT NOT NULL, completed_state BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE ); -- Insert some sample data into the table INSERT INTO todos (task, user_id, completed_state) VALUES ('Finish writing blog post', 'kp_123', FALSE), ('Buy groceries', 'kp_456', TRUE), ('Work out at the gym', 'kp_789', FALSE), ('Read 10 pages of a book', 'kp_101', TRUE); -- Enable row-level security ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ``` This command creates a `todos` table with the following columns: - **`task`**: with a type of **text**. - **`user_id`**: with a type of **text**. - **`completed_state`**: with a type of **boolean**. We use boolean because the completed state of each item is either true or false. It also inserts four sample todo items. We will need this for later. 4. Create another new snippet and run the following SQL statement to enable the row-level policy. ```sql create policy "users can read only their todos" on public.todos for select to public using (get_user_id() = user_id); ``` Your database policy is now set up to ensure that only the authenticated user's to-do items are displayed. In the next step, you'll update your table rows to include user IDs. ## **Step 2: Build a simple to-do app** 1. Open the `/components/hero.tsx` file with your favorite code editor. 2. Add the following code to `hero.tsx` which is a basic to-do list table: ```tsx import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server" export async function Hero() { const supabase = await createClient() const { data: todos } = await supabase.from("todos").select() return ( <div className="flex flex-col gap-16 items-center"> <table style={{ width: "100%", borderCollapse: "collapse" }}> <thead> <tr> <th style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px", textAlign: "left", backgroundColor: "#f2f2f2", }} > ID </th> <th style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px", textAlign: "left", backgroundColor: "#f2f2f2", }} > Task </th> <th style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px", textAlign: "left", backgroundColor: "#f2f2f2", }} > Is Complete </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> {todos?.map((row) => ( <tr key={row.id}> <td style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px" }}> {row.id} </td> <td style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px" }}> {row.task} </td> <td style={{ border: "1px solid #ddd", padding: "8px" }}> {String(row.completed_state)} </td> </tr> ))} </tbody> </table> </div> ) } ``` 3. Run the project with the following terminal command: ```bash npm run dev ``` 4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), sign in/sign up, and preview the page. You won’t see any to-do items because we haven’t set any user ID yet. ![Empty to do list](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/a7a2213e-a5db-43cd-7d12-b33bb2cc6100/public) ## **Step 3: Link Kinde ID to to-do items** 1. Sign in to your Kinde dashboard and select **Users** to view the user list. 2. Locate the user registered with your Supabase to-do app (e.g: Tamal Chowdhury) and select their name to view their profile. [List of Kinde users](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/9a063bd4-4aaf-4f7d-d4d2-2e9425a06f00/public) 3. Copy the unique **Kinde profile ID** displayed on their profile page. [Kinde profile ID](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8ca5c4de-0a28-4f1a-8baa-e960d79c3e00/public) 4. Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase project, and open the **todos** table. 5. Locate the rows corresponding to your to-do items and update the `user_id` column with the Kinde ID you copied. Save your changes. ![to-do items](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/bf7a1ea7-0cb8-4512-3935-55b5d03f1e00/public) 6. In the Kinde project, log in with the same user you signed up with. Verify that the to-do items linked to this user are now visible on the **to-do page** of your app. ![to-do list finished](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/fc135833-78c1-4277-e3d1-6f92cfcad600/public) This step links the Kinde user ID to specific to-do items, enabling the app to filter and display tasks based on the authenticated users. ## Excellent work! You’ve successfully built a secure and personalized to-do app using Kinde for authentication and Supabase for database management. With this foundation, your app is now equipped to manage user authentication and personalized data securely. You can extend this project further by adding features like task creation, deletion, updates, or even real-time collaboration.

Navigate to **SQL Editor** and select **New SQL Snippet**. ![New SQL Snippet](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/24671391-0aa5-466a-8860-887468ac6200/public) 14. Paste the following SQL code into the command window and select **Run**: ```sql create or replace function get_user_id() returns text language sql stable as $$ select nullif(current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub', '')::text; $$; ``` This function extracts the `sub` field from the JSON Web Token (JWT) sent by Kinde auth. The `sub` field contains the Kinde user ID, which allows Supabase to authenticate the correct Kinde user. ## Step 3: Setup a Next.js project with Supabase and Kinde 1. Run the following command in your terminal window to start a new project with Next.js and Supabase. Follow the on-screen instructions. ```bash npx create-next-app -e with-supabase ``` 2. Set a name for your project (e.g: `kinde-with-supabase`) 3. Go into the project directory: ```bash cd kinde-with-supabase ``` 4. Install the Kinde dependency with this command: ```bash npm install @kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs jsonwebtoken npm install --save-dev @types/jsonwebtoken ``` 5. Create the Kinde auth endpoint in this path **app/api/auth/[kindeAuth]**: ```bash mkdir -p "app/api/auth/[kindeAuth]" touch "app/api/auth/[kindeAuth]/route.js" ``` 6. Open the newly created `route.js` file, enter the following code, and save the file: ```bash import { handleAuth } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server" export const GET = handleAuth() ``` 7. Create an environment variables file `.env.local` by typing: ```bash touch .env.local ``` 8. Add the following to your `.env.local` file: - The Kinde environment vars details you copied earlier. You can get these again from your Kinde application Quick start page. - The Supabase Project URL from **Supabase > Project Settings > Data API > Project URL.** - The Publishable key from **Supabase > Project Settings > API Keys > API Keys** tab **→ Publishable key** ``` KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<kinde_client_id> KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<kinde_client_secret> KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://<your_kinde_business>.kinde.com KINDE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000 NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<supabase_project_id>.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=<supabase_publishable_key> ``` 9. To ensure the user is redirected to the homepage after they sign in, update the `KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` in your `.env.local` file to: ``` KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000 ``` 10. Open the `components/auth-button.tsx` file and replace the entire content with the following. This code will replace Supabase Auth functions with Kinde Auth. ```tsx import { RegisterLink, LoginLink, LogoutLink, } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components" import { getKindeServerSession } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server" import { Button } from "./ui/button" export async function AuthButton() { const { getUser } = getKindeServerSession() const user = await getUser() return user ? ( <div className="flex items-center gap-4"> Hey, {user.email}!<LogoutLink className="text-subtle">Log out</LogoutLink> </div> ) : ( <div className="flex gap-2"> <Button asChild size="sm" variant={"outline"}> <LoginLink className="btn btn-ghost sign-in-btn">Sign in</LoginLink> </Button> <Button asChild size="sm" variant={"default"}> <RegisterLink className="btn btn-dark">Sign up</RegisterLink> </Button> </div> ) } ``` 11. Replace `lib/supabase/server.ts` with the following code: ```tsx import { getKindeServerSession } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server" import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr" import { cookies } from "next/headers" import jwt from "jsonwebtoken" export const createClient = async () => { const cookieStore = await cookies() const { getIdToken } = getKindeServerSession() const idToken = await getIdToken() let token: string if (idToken) { token = jwt.sign(idToken, process.env.KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET!) } else { token = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY! } return createServerClient( process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY!, { global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, }, }, cookies: { getAll() { return cookieStore.getAll() }, setAll(cookiesToSet) { try { cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => { cookieStore.set(name, value, options) }) } catch (error) { // The `set` method was called from a Server Component. // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing // user sessions. } }, }, } ) } ``` 12. Replace `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` with the following code: ```tsx import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from "next/server" import { hasEnvVars } from "../utils" export async function updateSession(request: NextRequest) { const supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({ request, }) // If the env vars are not set, skip middleware check. You can remove this once you setup the project. if (!hasEnvVars) { return supabaseResponse } // Do not run code between createServerClient and // supabase.auth.getUser(). A simple mistake could make it very hard to debug // issues with users being randomly logged out. // IMPORTANT: DO NOT REMOVE auth.getUser() // IMPORTANT: You *must* return the supabaseResponse object as it is. // If you're creating a new response object with NextResponse.next() make sure to: // 1. Pass the request in it, like so: // const myNewResponse = NextResponse.next({ request }) // 2. Copy over the cookies, like so: // myNewResponse.cookies.setAll(supabaseResponse.cookies.getAll()) // 3. Change the myNewResponse object to fit your needs, but avoid changing // the cookies! // 4. Finally: // return myNewResponse // If this is not done, you may be causing the browser and server to go out // of sync and terminate the user's session prematurely! return supabaseResponse } ``` 13. Start the development environment by typing the following in your terminal: ```bash npm run dev ``` 14. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and sign up/sign in to your Kinde application to test the integration. ![Your local app showing supabase readiness](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/115c087b-d820-444e-7809-a059c37fa400/public) ## Well done!

integrate, third-party-tools

Kinde gives you several options for extracting your data, while we work toward providing a more comprehensive analytics feature. ## Google analytics Kinde lets you integrate with [Google Analytics](/manage-users/view-activity/track-user-sign-in-with-google-analytics/), so you can track sign up patterns, rates, frequency, etc. To start using it, enter your Google UA or G-tag in **Settings > Environment > Details > Tracking**. ## The state parameter If GA does not give you the specific information you need, you might be able to use the `state` parameter as a solution. The `state` parameter is used to store a unique code for each sign up flow, adding security to the authentication experience. But It can also be harnessed to correlate unique marketing IDs (such as UTM codes) along with it. Here’s how it works: 1. Your campaign ad carries a unique ID for the campaign. 2. A user clicks through the campaign to sign up to your app or product. 3. A unique event code is generated and the unique ID from the ad is picked up and passed through the Kinde auth process in the `state` parameter. 4. A token is issued for the user by Kinde, then Kinde redirects your user back, passing the same `state` parameter. The value of the `state` can then be used to correlate back any ad-specific information or call the advertiser’s API. Any information you need after the authentication flow, can be correlated with the passed through `state` parameter value. See the [definition of State in Using Kinde without an SDK](/developer-tools/about/using-kinde-without-an-sdk/#state).

[Shopify Multipass](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/multipass) lets you seamlessly log your users from your application to Shopify, passing over related metadata about your user via a token. ## What you need - A Kinde account, this will work on all Kinde plans. - [Shopify Plus plan](https://www.shopify.com/au/pricing/) and [Multipass enabled.](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/multipass/) ## Configure Multipass in your project The following example uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), however this can also be configured in other languages and frameworks. ### Add new environment variables Add Shopify and Multipass settings to your .env file. ```shell title=".env SHOPIFY_MULTIPASS_SECRET = "[Your Mulitpass secret]"; SHOPIFY_STORE_URL = "[yourshopify].myshopify.com"; ``` ### Set up API endpoint Create an endpoint file, e.g. `/api/multipass` that contains the following. Make sure to replace the generic information with your specific domain and secret information. ```tsx import {NextResponse} from "next/server"; import {jwtDecoder, type JWTDecoded} from "@kinde/jwt-decoder"; import {cookies} from "next/headers"; import {Multipass} from "multipass-js"; export async function GET() { const decodedToken = jwtDecoder<JWTDecoded & {email: string}>(cookies().get("id_token")?.value); if (decodedToken) { const multipass = new Multipass(process.env.SHOPIFY_MULTIPASS_SECRET as string); const customerData = { // Required email: decodedToken?.email, created_at: decodedToken?.iat // add additional fields here }; const url = multipass .withCustomerData(customerData) .withDomain(process.env.SHOPIFY_STORE_URL as string) .url(); return NextResponse.redirect(url, 302); } else { const params = new URLSearchParams(); params.append("post_login_redirect_url", `${process.env.KINDE_SITE_URL}/api/multipass`); return NextResponse.redirect( `${process.env.KINDE_SITE_URL}/api/auth/login?${params.toString()}`, 302 ); } } ``` Shopify Multipass is now configured with Kinde. When you redirect the user to the endpoint `/api/multipass`, this will generate the Multipass token and redirect the user logged in to your Shopify site.

# Integrate - Third party tools - Integrate fraud detection with TrustPath

> Comprehensive guide to integrating TrustPath fraud detection with Kinde workflows including risk assessment, threat detection rules, and API integration for secure authentication

trustpath, fraud detection, workflows, risk assessment, threat detection, api integration, security, m2m application
integrate, third-party-tools

This guide shows you how to build a Fraud Detection Workflow that runs after user authentication in **Kinde**, and uses **TrustPath** to detect and block potentially fraudulent sign-ins and sign-ups. The core idea: **whenever a user signs in or registers**, Kinde sends data to TrustPath. Based on the risk score it returns, Kinde allows or denies access. TrustPath works with Kinde workflows to trigger certain actions at key points in the authentication journey, using your own code. ## What you need Here’s what you need to get started. - **Kinde account** - [Create one](https://app.kinde.com/register) for free if you haven’t already. You’ll also need to set up an application in Kinde. - **Kinde M2M application** - Create a [dedicated M2M app](https://docs.kinde.com/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/) for accessing the Kinde Management API - **TrustPath account** - [Sign up](https://console.trustpath.io/login) here if you don’t have one. A free account does not require any payment information. - **TrustPath API access** - Grab an API key from the [TrustPath console](https://console.trustpath.io). - **Git repo for storing your code** - clone [this repository](https://github.com/trust-path/kinde-trustpath-integration-example). It contains integration code that is already prepared for use with this guide. ## Step 1: Set up the workflow and connect your repo For a workflow to function in Kinde, the workflow files need to be structured and set up in a specific way. Refer to the docs to get this part right. 1. [Create a new workflow](/workflows/getting-started/workflow-files/) or [clone a template workflow](https://github.com/trust-path/kinde-trustpath-integration-example). 2. [Connect your GitHub repo](/workflows/getting-started/connect-repo-for-workflows/) to execute the workflow. ## Step 2: Define the workflow entry point The workflow starts with a simple async function triggered after user authentication: ```js export default async function FraudDetectionWorkflow(event: onPostAuthenticationEvent) { } ``` The event parameter gives us initial context—such as the user ID, IP address, and whether this is a new user. But we need to enrich this data before we can send it to TrustPath. We’ll do this in the next step. ## Step 3: Fetch full user data from Kinde To make an informed decision, TrustPath. needs more than a user ID—it also needs the user's email, first name, and last name. To get this data from Kinde, do the following. 1. [Set up an M2M application](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/) to access the Kinde Management API and switch on the `read:users` scope. 2. Copy the Client ID and Client secret from the above application. 3. Create two new [environment variables](/workflows/configuration/environment-variables-and-secrets/) in Kinde. Go to **Settings > Data management > Env variables**. 4. Add the following variables: | Key | Value | Sensitive | | --- | --- | --- | | KINDE_WF_M2M_CLIENT_ID | Copy from M2M application | No | | KINDE_WF_M2M_CLIENT_SECRET | Copy from M2M application | Yes | Once these are set up, you can retrieve the additional data you need, using the `createKindeAPI` helper from [@kinde/infrastructure](https://github.com/kinde-oss/infrastructure), which allows us to call the Kinde Management API: ```js const kindeAPI = await createKindeAPI(event); const user = await getUserData(kindeAPI, event.context.user.id); async function getUserData(kindeAPI: any, userId: string) { const { data: user } = await kindeAPI.get({ endpoint: `user?id=${userId}` }); return user; } ``` ## Step 4: Set up your TrustPath API key **TrustPath** requires an API key to authenticate your requests, in this case a request that originates from the Kinde workflow. To get your API Key: 1. Log in to the [TrustPath Console](https://console.trustpath.io). 2. On the left-hand menu, go to **[Your Name] > API Keys**. 3. Copy either one of the API keys provided there. (Recommended) Store the API key securely as an [environment variable](/workflows/configuration/environment-variables-and-secrets/) in **Kinde**, just like the other variables mentioned above. ```js const trustPathAPIKey = getEnvironmentVariable("TRUSTPATH_API_KEY")?.value; ``` This ensures you’re not hardcoding sensitive credentials, and it keeps your app secure and maintainable. ## Step 5: Determine the event type TrustPath evaluates risk differently based on the event type. For example, account creation versus account sign in. ```js const isNewUser = event.context.auth.isNewUserRecordCreated; const eventType = isNewUser ? "account_register" : "account_login"; ``` We check whether the user is new and set the event type accordingly: - `account_register`: Used for new sign-ups - typically includes more rigorous fraud checks. - `account_login`: Used for existing users - can focus on things like account takeover detection. By classifying the event properly, you can take advantage of TrustPath's specialized rule sets. ## Step 6: Define TrustPath threat detection rules TrustPath threat detection rules are individual risk assessment criteria designed to identify fraudulent activities. Each rule analyzes specific signals to detect suspicious behavior and assigns a risk score to the event. Each risk detected then contributes to the total risk score, which ranges from 0 to 100. - A score of 0 means no risk (approve) - A score of 100 means very risky (decline) You need to set up separate rules for `account_register` and `account_login` events. Select **Threat Rules** from the menu and choose the card labeled **Account Register** to configure it. TrustPath offers the flexibility to add your own rules, but it also provides default rules tailored to each event type. ![Threat rules in TrustPath dashboard](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/eada27f8-80b4-4c2b-0f3f-a379fda7b800/public) ![TrustPath Rules library](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/2b574b60-336c-4a2b-7585-e1f575537800/public) Here’s an example of how to add a rule for the account register event. 1. Select **Add Rule From Library** in the top right corner. 2. From the list, select the following rules by clicking on each rule: - Email addresses are disposable. - IP Address is a Tor exit node. - Email server IP addresses have abuse reports. This will enable any new account registration on Kinde to perform IP and email threat signal checks. Next, configure rules for the account log in event. For this, we want to prevent users from entering the system with disposable email addresses, as well as detect rapid IP changes, which can be a sign of unusual behavior. Here’s where you configure rules for the `account_login` event. ![Event type rules in TrustPath](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/5902e60b-45b8-470d-8ec1-4fd46e6ec100/public) You can see we have some rules switched on, and each rule has a score. The example above detects rapid IP changes and blocks users by assigning a high risk score, which signals potential issues. ### Advanced rule configuration The above rule can be strengthened by adding browser fingerprinting to IP change detection. For instance, the rule might be: “*if the same user email sees more than three different IP addresses within five minutes **and** also has a new browser fingerprint”*, it’s a stronger signal of suspicious activity. When set up, this detects a user logging in from multiple locations or while traveling—where the IP may change, but the browser fingerprint typically remains consistent if they’re using the same device. TrustPath supports many advanced configurations like this. You can contact their team to help you set up any complex rules you want. ## Step 7: Build the request body Now that we have the user info and event type, we can build the payload to send to TrustPath when the workflow is triggered. ```js const requestBody = { ip: event.request.ip.split(",")[0].trim(), // Handles cases where multiple IPs are forwarded email: user.preferred_email, user: { user_id: event.context.user.id, first_name: user.first_name, last_name: user.last_name, }, event_type: eventType, }; ``` This information passed in the request body allows TrustPath to cross-reference behavioral history, analyze IP risk, and more. ## Step 8: Call the TrustPath Risk API Once the connection is set up between APIs, data is ready to be sent to TrustPath via a standard HTTP POST request. Here’s an example: ```js const response = await kinde.fetch( "https://api.trustpath.io/v1/risk/evaluate", { method: "POST", responseFormat: "json", headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${trustPathAPIKey}`, "Content-Type": "application/json", }, body: JSON.stringify(requestBody), } ); ``` This request is made using `kinde.fetch`, which handles outbound API calls securely within the workflow context. ## Step 9: Evaluate the response and take action When the API call to TrustPath comes back, the response will include a state field showing one of three values: - **approve** - let the user through - **review** - optionally flags cases for manual review - **decline** - block access Here's how to enforce a block for declined requests: ```js const state = response.json.data.score.state; if (state === "decline") { denyAccess( "You are not allowed to access this resource. Request declined by TrustPath.io ); } ``` You can adapt this to handle review flags differently, or to just mark it for review. ## Step 10: Test your fraud detection setup Now that everything is set up, we can test the entire flow. Starting with the `account_register event`, select a disposable email address (choosing any from your favorite search engine should be sufficient) and try to create a new account on Kinde. Once everything is set up and deployed: 1. Log in or register using your test account 2. Check TrustPath's Event History to see the result 3. By default, new accounts will return **approve** until you define threat rules in TrustPath. You can also test the `account_login` event by simulating logins from different IP addresses—using a VPN is a simple way to do this. ## Support If you need extra support, here’s where to get it. - **TrustPath support:** For questions related to fraud detection rules, API integration, or threat analysis, visit **TrustPath**, [contact the TrustPath team](https://trustpath.io/contact), or view the TrustPath [API docs](https://docs.trustpath.io/). - **Kinde support:** For help with authentication workflows, triggers, or general setup, refer to the [Kinde docs](https://docs.kinde.com/) or reach out to [our support team](https://kinde.com/support/). TrustPath is a German-based company. Their team wrote this guide to help Kinde users.

<Aside type="warning"> If you are experiencing issues with webhooks, it could be because the webhooks request content-type header has changed from `application/json` to `application/jwt`. Read the full details [here](https://kinde.notion.site/Important-notice-for-webhooks-users-7fcf184faece41368603e513267dffc6). We apologize for any inconvenience. </Aside> Webhooks are a way of monitoring events in Kinde, so that you can be notified and take action when something you’re monitoring happens. <Aside type="upgrade"> Depending which Kinde plan you’re on, the number of webhooks you can create might be limited. [View plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/). </Aside> ## How webhooks work When you create a webhook, you register your own URL endpoints in Kinde and associate them with a Kinde event (e.g. when a user is created). When an endpoint is triggered, Kinde sends data about the event, so that you can initiate an action in your application or store the data. A simple example would be setting up a webhook for when a new user is created in Kinde. This event can be set up to trigger an update to your database, enabling your system to automatically send a welcome email. ## Webhooks flow 1. Webhook endpoints are registered in Kinde. 2. An event occurs in your account, e.g. `user.created`. 3. Your endpoint will be called with a JWT containing the data object about that event, and details about the webhook. 1. If a `200` response is received, the workflow is complete. 2. If it fails to receive a response, it will retry using a back-off policy (see **Webhooks responses and retry policy** below). 4. In your application you should verify the authenticity of the webhook request, and decode the JWT (see **Webhooks security** below). 5. Logic is triggered in your application using the event data. ## Webhooks identifiers There are a number of unique IDs you will come across with webhooks. - **Webhook ID**: prefixed with `webhook_`, this refers to the webhooks that you create in Kinde. Webhook IDs are exposed via the Kinde Management API webhook endpoints. You can get a list of webhooks via the endpoint `GET /api/v1/webhooks` - **Event ID**: prefixed with `event_`, this is the ID of an event that has occurred in your account, and is included as `event_id` in webhook request payloads. You can use this ID to retrieve an event from Kinde’s API using `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` - **Webhook Request ID**: found in the webhook headers as `webhook-id`, this is unique to a webhook and event, and will not change between attempts. You can use this as the idempotency key (see Webhooks security below). ## Webhooks decoder Kinde provides a [webhooks decoder](https://github.com/kinde-oss/webhook) to help you decode and validate webhook tokens, for an easier implementation. ## Webhooks security ### Idempotency key Each webhook has a webhook-id header that can be used to avoid reprocessing the same webhook request. This is referred to as the ‘idempotency key’ meaning that multiple requests will result in the same outcome. ### Prevent Replay Attacks A replay attack occurs when a payload is intercepted, potentially modified and re-transmitted. Kinde webhooks contain a ‘timestamp’ attribute in the payload, and the payload is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This allows you to verify that the request came from Kinde, and check the timestamp to prevent replay attacks. ### Verify an event You can request events by their event_id using the Kinde management api via `/api/v1/events/{event_id}`. The event_id is provided in all webhook requests. ## Webhooks best practices Ensure webhooks are secure and optimized. - Handle duplicate request attempts by checking that the webhook-id header has not already been received and processed, making your processing idempotent - Verify the JWT to ensure that the request came from Kinde using your public JWKS file - Only add the events to your endpoint that your implementation requires, listening for all events creates unnecessary load on your server - Endpoints must use HTTPS - Return a 200 from your endpoint to indicate it has received the request ## Webhooks responses and retry policy If we fail to receive a 200 response from your endpoint, Kinde operates a back-off retry policy, this roughly equates to the following attempts: - Immediately - After 5 seconds - After 30 seconds - After 2 minutes - After 10 minutes - After 1 hour - After 4 hours - Every 12 hours until 36 hours ## Webhooks terminology You’ll come across these terms when you start using webhooks. **Endpoint** - the URL called when an event occurs. **Event type** - something that happens in Kinde, e.g. a user is created. **Event** - an instance of an event type that happens in Kinde, e.g. Jane Doe just signed up. **Request** - the request object sent to your endpoint that contains a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the event data and details about the event. **Attempt** - an instance of a request making an http request, multiple request attempts may be made if we do not receive a 200 response.

[See all plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/). </Aside> ## Webhook security Webhook request payloads are signed and sent as a JSON Web Token (JWT) from Kinde. You’re probably using a library to validate your JWTs and they will require the url for your public JSON Web Key (also known as a `jwks` file). The jwks file can be found at `https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/.well-known/jwks` ## Add a webhook 1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**. 2. Select **Add webhook**. 3. Give the webhook a name and enter a description so it’s clear what it’s for. 4. Enter the external URL. 5. Select the event triggers. You can choose from a number of triggers and categories. See below for definitions. ## Edit a webhook 1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**. 2. Select the webhook name to open the details window. 3. Update events and triggers. 4. Select **Save**. ## Delete a webhook 1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**. 2. Select the three dots menu next to the webhook you want to delete. 3. Select **Delete webhook**. A confirmation message appears. 4. Confirm you want to delete the webhook. ## Manage webhooks via the Kinde API Everything you can do in Kinde’s UI with webhooks, you can also do through the Kinde API using these endpoints. - `POST api/v1/webhooks` - create a webhook - `PATCH api/v1/webhook/{webhook_id}` - update a webhook - `DELETE api/v1/webhook/{webhook_id}` - delete a webhook - `GET api/v1/webhooks` - list of available webhooks Events can also be retrieved using: - `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` - get an event by the event_id provided in a webhook - `GET /api/v1/event_types` - list the available event types ## Webhook triggers ### Authentication webhooks ```jsx organization.created; user.created; user.authentication_failed; user.authenticated; subscriber.created; access_request.created; ``` ### User management webhooks ```jsx role.created; role.updated; role.deleted; permission.created; permission.updated; permission.deleted; organization.updated; organization.deleted; user.updated; user.deleted; ``` ### Billing webhooks ```jsx customer.agreement_cancelled; customer.agreement_created; customer.invoice_overdue; customer.meter_usage_updated; customer.payment_failed; customer.payment_succeeded; customer.plan_created; customer.plan_assigned; customer.plan_changed; ``` <Aside> The `user.created` trigger does not create a call when you import users </Aside> ## Testing webhooks locally In order to use webhooks, you need a publicly available URL. To test locally you need to use a proxy to expose your local instance on the internet. Here are a couple of free tools to help you to do this. - [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) - fast and easy, we recommend using the `—subdomain` attribute to fix the issued subdomain. - [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - for intermediate users, requires some dev experience to get set up. Each of these services exposes a local port though a public URL that can be set as your web socket.

You may need to alter some code samples if you have a different setup, but the core instructions remain the same. ## Set up local development In order to use webhooks, you need a publicly available URL. To test locally you need to use a proxy to expose your local instance on the internet. Here are a couple of free tools to help you to do this. - [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) - fast and easy, we recommend using the `—subdomain` attribute to fix the issued subdomain. - [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - for intermediate users, requires some dev experience to get set up. Each of these services expose a local port though a public URL that can be set as your web socket. Follow their instructions to run your local Next.js application and you will receive a URL that you need later in this guide. ## Create the Kinde webhook route Kinde sends webhooks as JWT’s to make them both easy and secure. In this example we will leverage 2 libraries to parse the JWT and verify the signature. 1. Create the file `app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts`. The `route.ts` file is a specific file convention in Next.js that marks the route as an API route, rather than a page. ```jsx // app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts import { NextResponse } from "next/server"; export async function POST(req: Request) { return NextResponse.json({ status: 200, statusText: "success" }); } ``` Whenever an event occurs in Kinde, a POST request is sent via this route to the specified endpoint, so that your project can react to the event. For example, refreshing a token or updating data in your database. Note that the endpoint needs to be publicly available, with no route protection. 2. Install the dependencies. <PackageManagers pkg="jwks-rsa jsonwebtoken" /> 3. Update your file as follows: ```jsx // app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts import { NextResponse } from "next/server"; import jwksClient from "jwks-rsa"; import jwt from "jsonwebtoken"; // The Kinde issuer URL should already be in your `.env` file // from when you initially set up Kinde. This will fetch your // public JSON web keys file const client = jwksClient({ jwksUri: `${process.env.KINDE_ISSUER_URL}/.well-known/jwks.json`, }); export async function POST(req: Request) { try { // Get the token from the request const token = await req.text(); // Decode the token const { header } = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true }); const { kid } = header; // Verify the token const key = await client.getSigningKey(kid); const signingKey = key.getPublicKey(); const event = await jwt.verify(token, signingKey); // Handle various events switch (event?.type) { case "user.updated": // handle user updated event // e.g update database with event.data console.log(event.data); break; case "user.created": // handle user created event // e.g add user to database with event.data console.log(event.data); break; default: // other events that we don't handle break; } } catch (err) { if (err instanceof Error) { console.error(err.message); return NextResponse.json({ message: err.message }, { status: 400 }); } } return NextResponse.json({ status: 200, statusText: "success" }); } ``` As per the sample above, the JWKs file is fetched from Kinde, the token is decoded, and the signature is compared against your keys file. This is how you know you can trust the request has come from Kinde. <Aside title="Handling different event types"> In the example above, we used a switch statement. But you could also set up an endpoint per event type, group them into related endpoints, use a map, or any other method for splitting and managing the events. </Aside> 4. Start your server so it’s ready and listening out for the next step. With most Next.js applications, run `npm run dev` in the terminal. ## Set up the webhook in Kinde 1. In the Kinde, go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**. 2. Select **Add webhook**. 3. Give the webhook a name and description. 4. Enter the Next.js endpoint we set up earlier in your project. For example `<your_app_url>/api/kinde-webhook`. If you are using an external tool to test the endpoint locally, enter the endpoint URL specified in the tool. <Aside type="warning" title="Make sure URLs match"> Testing will fail if the endpoint URL in Kinde does not match the site URL where you are testing the webhook. </Aside> 5. Select **Add events.** 6. In the dialog that opens, select the events you want. For example, user events, organization events, etc. 7. Select **Save**. 8. In the webhook window, select **Save**. ## Test the webhook 1. Either create a new user or update an existing one in Kinde. 2. Switch back to where your server is running and you should see the data in your server console. 3. Done! Have a tasty beverage.

# Integrate - Webhooks - Connect Zapier to Kinde

When we first introduced a Zapier connection, it was to offer approximate webhooks functionality, until we had [actual webhooks](/integrate/webhooks/about-webhooks/). Now that we have webhooks, you can still integrate with Zapier, it just works a bit different. Here’s how: <YoutubeVideo videoId={"2C0GNM0t-sY"} />
