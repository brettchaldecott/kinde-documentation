Kinde lets you quickly generate a test token for testing your APIs with Kinde. This can save you time generating a token via Postman or other service.

This process assumes you have [registered](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/) your API with Kinde, and have [authorized an M2M application](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/#authorize-or-revoke-authorization-of-an-app-from-the-api) to access it. 

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > APIs**.
2. Select **View details** on your API.
3. Select **Test** in the menu.
4. Select an authorized application to test API access.
5. Select **Get token**. An access token and copyable code snippets are generated. 
6. You can copy the token and inspect it.

7. Use the provided token to test your API.
