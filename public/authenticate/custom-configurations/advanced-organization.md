Only businesses on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) can enable advanced organization features. Additional fees apply.

</Aside>

When you enable advanced organizations features, you can access extended features for individual organizations. Customizations include:

- Additional access control via [policies](/build/organizations/organization-access-policies/)
- Select [default roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/default-user-roles/#enable-default-roles-in-an-organization) for users who join an organization
- Set [custom email sender details](/build/organizations/email-sender-organization/), so users in specific orgs receive OTP and other emails from the custom address (requires own SMTP)
- Organization-level [custom domains](/build/domains/organization-custom-domain/)
- Organization-level [multi-factor authentication](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/mfa-per-org/)
