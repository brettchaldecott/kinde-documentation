A common pattern in B2B products is for users who belong to multiple organizations, to be able to [switch between them](/authenticate/manage-authentication/navigate-between-organizations/). However, if you have a switcher in your application, you may want users to be signed in to the most recent organization instead.

If you switch this function on, users will not be shown an organization switcher on the authentication screen, and instead will be signed in to the most recent organization.

## Sign users in to the last used organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Policies**.
2. In the **Sign in** section, select the **Sign users in to most recent org** option.
3. Select **Save**.
