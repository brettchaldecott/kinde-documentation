## HIPAA

![HIPAA and AssuranceLab HIPAA logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/88d46614-1631-48ae-fcf4-a0ee7c121c00/public)

Kinde is HIPAA compliant and supports our customers as a Business Associate. Reach out to our team if you need a Business Associate Agreement in place before working with us.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a US federal law on how to protect sensitive health information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI), which led to the creation of the Privacy Rule and Security Rule. It has since been updated with additional rules and supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009.

More information about HIPAA can be found on the US Department of Health and Human Services's [health information privacy](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) page.

## CCPA and CPRA

![CCPA and CPRA logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/ffc476f3-6b5f-43ac-8406-d6ab5dce8100/public)

Kinde is compliant with the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) and supports our customers by maintaining strict privacy principles.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that companies collect about them. The law took effect on January 1, 2020 (its initial regulations were approved on August 14, 2020) and applies to companies targeting or collecting data related to California residents. An amendment—the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)—expanded the CCPA’s scope; it became legally effective on December 16, 2020, most substantive provisions became operative on January 1, 2023 (with a look-back to data collected on or after January 1, 2022), and formal enforcement began July 1, 2023.

More information can be found on the California Attorney General’s [CCPA/CPRA page](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and the California Privacy Protection Agency’s website.

## PCI-DSS

![PCI logo](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8358875d-ac43-43d3-f794-3d72bf3f1800/public)

Please note that Kinde does not hold a PCI-DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) from a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).

In preparation for Kinde’s upcoming customer billing feature, we have engaged with a QSA to validate our scoping and we are preparing the necessary Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to meet the PCI-DSS requirements for processing cardholder data. Currently we use a third party service provider and their SAQ-A scoped method, which greatly reduces the scope that Kinde has to meet as a PCI-DSS Service Provider.

Our SAQ and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) will be available when scoping work is completed and will transition to a Level 1 Service Provider when the necessary transaction volume is reached.

More information about PCI can be found at the [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) website.
