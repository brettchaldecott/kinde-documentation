At Kinde we want to empower founders to build their product their way, and integrate with us in a way that suits them. That’s why we’re building out the Kinde Management API and allowing Kinde users to register their API with us as well.

## Access the Kinde Management API

You can only access Kinde's API via machine to machine (M2M) applications. Once connected, you can use our API to integrate Kinde functionality in your app without the admin interface layer. [Check out the API docs](/kinde-apis/management/).

## Integrate by registering your own API

If your product has its own APIs, you can register them with Kinde to ensure access requests to your endpoints are secure and authorized. See [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/).
