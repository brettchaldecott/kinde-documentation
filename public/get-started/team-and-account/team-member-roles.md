You can invite other team members and give them access to your business on Kinde. To simplify access control, Kinde has provided a number of pre-defined roles. 

## Team member roles (Paid plans)

On Kinde paid plans, there are a range of specific roles that can be assigned to team members. This allows you to restrict actions that you may want limited to certain people in your business.

**Owner** - The person who creates the business in Kinde is automatically the Owner. They have the highest access level in the Kinde business and can assign any role to anyone. Only an owner can approve data export from Kinde.

**Admin** - Comprehensive access to manage all aspects of the system, excluding the ability to assign or modify the Owner role.

**Customer success** - Manage user accounts, subscriptions, and organization settings to support customer onboarding and retention.

**Engineer** - Configure applications, APIs, environments, feature flags, and integrations. Access audit logs for debugging and monitoring.

**Finance** - Oversee your business’s subscription to Kinde, including plan type and payment details.

**Marketing** - Manage branding elements, email templates, and content-related settings to ensure a consistent user experience.

**Read-only** - Read-only access across all system areas for monitoring and review purposes without the ability to make changes.

**Security specialist** - Manage authentication methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and security policies for your business.

## Team member roles (Free plan)

The Kinde free plan comes with just the Owner and Admin roles.

**Owner** - The person who creates the business in Kinde is automatically the Owner. They have the highest access level in the Kinde business. Only an owner can approve data export from Kinde.

**Admin** - All other team members in Kinde are created as Admins. They have access to all Kinde features, except data export approval and the ability to change the Owner role.

## How team member roles work

- Team members can have any mix of roles, such as Customer success / Engineer / Finance / Marketing / Security specialist. Although it may be easier to give admin rights if broad access is needed.
- Only Owners can promote other team members to Owners
- Any combo of roles can be assigned to team members when they are invited to Kinde
- Roles are gated to prevent being changed by users without sufficient permissions. i.e a read-only person can’t make someone an Owner

## Change the role of a team member

You need sufficient role permissions to be able to change member roles. An owner can make any changes. An Admin can make any changes (except to the Owner role).

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Team members**. A list of your current team is shown.
2. Select the three dots next to the team member who's role you want to change.
3. In the menu that appears, select **Edit roles**.
4. Using the toggles, change the roles they will have in the business. This can be more than one. Note you are restricted by your own role as to your ability to change roles for others.
5. Select **Save**.
