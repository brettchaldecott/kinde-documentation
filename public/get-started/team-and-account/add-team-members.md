You can invite other team members and give them access to your business on Kinde. When you add new people, you can [add roles](/get-started/team-and-account/team-member-roles/) for them as well.

Paid plans come with [multiple pre-defined roles](/get-started/team-and-account/team-member-roles/). Free accounts come with an Owner and Admin role only.

## How team member roles work

- Team members can have any mix of roles, such as Customer success / Engineer / Finance / Marketing / Security specialist. Although it may be easier to give admin rights if broad access is needed.
- Only Owners can promote other team members to Owners
- Any combo of roles can be assigned to team members when they are invited to Kinde
- Roles are gated to prevent being changed by users without sufficient permissions. i.e a read-only person can’t make someone an Owner
