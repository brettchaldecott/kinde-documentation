For paid Kinde plans only. Not available on the free plan.

If you want your team members to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) when they sign in to Kinde, you can contact us to request this. 

We can set MFA so that it applies to everyone in your team, or only applies to certain roles, e.g. Owners within the business. 

## What to ask for when you request MFA

Send your MFA request to support@kinde.com, and include:

- The name of each business that MFA should apply to
- The MFA factors that you want your team to have available to them, e.g. one or more of these factors: email code, SMA code, Authenticator app.
- If you want MFA to be applied only to certain roles, such as **Owner**

Feel free to send any questions you have along with the request.
