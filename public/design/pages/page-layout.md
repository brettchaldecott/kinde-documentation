If you are not using [custom code for your page designs](/design/customize-with-code/customize-with-css-html/), you can still change the layout of pages (including auth pages), to control elements such as the background, alignment and position of page elements and widget.

After you’ve set the global brand, view how it looks on individual pages, and make additional changes. You can further customize:

- sign in page - what a user sees each time they sign in to their account
- sign up page - what a user sees when they first sign up to your business
- confirm sign in page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code each time they sign in.
- Confirm sign up page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code the first time they sign up.
- Emails - for when you send email from the company.
- Subscription page - the sign up page for new subscribers (if you use this)
- Request access page - when you're collecting a waiting list

To manage page design using your own CSS code, see [page design with code](/design/customize-with-code/understand-page-design/).
