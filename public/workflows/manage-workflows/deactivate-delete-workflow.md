There is a difference between deactivating and deleting a workflow. 

## Deactivate a workflow

Deactivating a workflow stops it from being triggered or used. The workflow cannot be triggered by users until you make the same or a different deployment live.

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Select the workflow you want to deactivate. The workflow **Summary** page opens.
3. In the **Live** section, select the three dots menu, then select **Deactivate**. 
4. Confirm that you want to deactivate. The workflow will be stopped. It will not work again until you make a deployment live.

## Delete a workflow

There are two parts to deleting a workflow:

### 1: Delete workflow files in your repo

Even when you delete the workflow from your repo it will remain in Kinde. This is to safeguard against error and to protect your auth flow. The workflow keeps running until you manually delete it.

### 2: Delete a workflow in Kinde

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Select the â€¦ menu next to the workflow and select **Delete workflow**. A confirmation window opens explaining what is about to happen.
3. Confirm the deletion.

<Aside>

A workflow will re-appear if you add the files back in your repo and sync the code again.
