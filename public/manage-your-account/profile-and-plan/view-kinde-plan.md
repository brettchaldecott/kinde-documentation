Whether you pay us to use Kinde or not, your Kinde account is linked to a plan. A plan describes what features and limits apply to your Kinde account. You'll have [selected a plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) when you first signed up with us.

## Plan options

Weâ€™ve made it so our free plan includes a lot, so you can run your business for free if you want. But you will see prompts throughout the Kinde admin area, indicating which features can be extended, included, or made unlimited, by upgrading.

You can also view [full plan details and comparisons](https://kinde.com/pricing/) on our website.
