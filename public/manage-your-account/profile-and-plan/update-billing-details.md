When you first set up a Kinde business, the **Owner** becomes the primary contact for billing and your account. 

You need to contact support@kinde.com to request:
- A change the invoice email address
- Updates to business details, such as address for tax purposes, etc.

We do plan to enable more self-service in this area, but for now we can only change these details on request.
