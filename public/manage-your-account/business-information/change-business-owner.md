A business Owner in Kinde has full power in the business, including setting any role for any member, and being able to assign the role of 'Owner' to others. You might need to change the owner of a business to reflect a new org structure or when someone leaves. [Read more about the roles in a Kinde business and how to assign them to members](/get-started/team-and-account/add-team-members/).

There can be multiple Owners in a business. 

## Promote a team member to Owner or demote a team member from Owner

You need to be a current Owner to perform this procedure.

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Team members**. A list of your current team is shown.
2. Select the three dots next to the team member who's role you want to change.
3. In the menu that appears, select **Edit roles**.
4. Using the toggles, change the roles they will have in the business to include or exclude Owner.
5. Select **Save**. The team member's role has been changed.

## Delete an Owner from a business

If an owner moves on or is replaced, you can [delete them from the business](/get-started/team-and-account/add-team-members/). 
First, make sure you have another Owner in place. Only an Owner can delete another Owner.
