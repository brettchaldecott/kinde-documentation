When you sign up with Kinde, you also create a kinde domain, e.g. `yourbusiness.kinde.com`. Once in use, the Kinde domain is not available to anyone else. Even if you delete your business on Kinde, the domain remains allocated. 

We do not recommend deleting your business, if you want to keep the domain.

## Does the Kinde domain matter?

Not really. Most founders and companies will use a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) to hide the "kinde" part. 

Even if you signed up with `testymctestface.kinde.com`, you can change your custom domain as many times as you like. If you're on a Kinde Scale plan, you can even have custom domains for orgs within your business.

## To change domains

If you really want to change domains, you'll need to register a new business with the domain you want. Kinde cannot update the domain for your existing business. 

## To start a new business but keep your domain

It's pretty common for people to kick our tyres. So if you've been playing around on the Free plan and want to start fresh, you can [delete your business](/manage-your-account/your-data/delete-business/) in Kinde. Then to get the same domain back, you need to formally request that we make it free for you to use again. It's a bit of a process, so we ask you to give us at least a few days to sort it out. 

The business owner must make the request to free the domain by sending us an email to support@kinde.com, from the email they signed up with.
