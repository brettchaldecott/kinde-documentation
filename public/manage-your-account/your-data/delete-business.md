Deleting a business in Kinde is a nuclear action that cannot be reversed. Only a business owner can delete the business.

## IMPORTANT: Read this document before you delete

### When you delete a business

- The domain associated with the business can't be used again (unless freed up by Kinde)
- All environments, applications, organizations, users, and stored data is destroyed
- Owner, admin, and team member access to the business is removed
- Any connections and integrations you set up will break

Once you delete a business, the action cannot be reversed.

<Aside type="warning">

Do not delete the business if you want to re-use the Kinde domain issued to the business. Instead, consider using a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/).

</Aside>

### Before you delete a business

- Make sure you [export your data](/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/) before you delete
- Remove any custom domain you have set up
- Let team members know they will no longer be able to access the business

## Delete your business

<Aside type="warning">

Only owners of businesses on a free plan can self-serve delete. All businesses on paid plans need to contact Kinde support.

</Aside>

1. Sign in to the business you want to delete.
2. Go to **Settings > Business > Details**.
3. Scroll to the the **Admin functions** section and select **Delete business**.
4. Confirm the action in the dialog by selecting **Delete business**. The business is deleted and can no longer be accessed.

## Other information

Team members who have access to multiple businesses can still access those businesses.

If you have other Kinde businesses, the data in those businesses will not be affected.

If you want to re-use the domain of the business you delete, you need to contact support@kinde.com to make this possible.
