The number of monthly active users (MAU) you have is a common metric for predicting recurring revenue and tracking business growth.

If you have business customers, the number of monthly active organizations (MAO) is another important indicator of how your business is going.

Higher MAU and MAO means more customers.

## **How MAU is calculated**

Kinde counts one MAU for every user who is ‘active’ during a billing period. Active means they have been issued at least one access token. One MAU is counted regardless of how many times the same user signs in.

If a user is created and then deleted before signing in, they are not counted in MAU. However, if a user signs in during a billing period and they are deleted within the same period, they are still counted in MAU.

## How MAO is calculated

If you are a B2B company, your business customers will be managed in Kinde as an organization.

For MAO calculations, Kinde considers an organization is 'active' if there are at least 2 users, and at least one of those users is active (i.e they sign in to the organization) during a billing period.

If an organization is created and deleted in the same monthly billing period, it will only be counted as MAO if the above conditions are met.

## To check your MAU and MAO
